	# How many thoughts have more than one truth vote?
	# How many unique users have logged votes?
	# How many thoughts have dissonance between users?
	# What is the distribution of truth votes?

	# Should reward less: correct alignment with the crowd
	# Should penalize more: incorrect contrarianism
	# Should penalize less: incorrect alignment with the crowd
